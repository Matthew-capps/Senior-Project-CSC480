1. Briefly describe your project. (About 2 sentences.)

For my senior project I will be developing and programming a website for a small company located in Longview, Washington. They sell a variety of homemade products from soap to skin care products. They are looking to start selling their products online or having a web page so their customers can view the products offered before they buy.

2. What is your particular role in the project?

Since I chose to work alone I will be performing all roles of the project from development and design to programming the web page.

3. What have you done personally in the two weeks leading up to Feb. 24?

Since 24 Feb. 2019 I have gather information from the client to create the database and the tables needed for the web page as well as started to design the actual web page.

4. Describe any significant progress made by the team as a whole in this time period.

My over all progress has been slow to start but since my client has given me the information needed for the database I have started inputting the data into the respected tables. Had a few bumps with communication and matching their schedule with work but overall I've made good progress.

5. Give a link to the journal file in your repository
