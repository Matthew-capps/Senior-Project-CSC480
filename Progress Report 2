1. What have you done personally since your last progress report?

Since my last progress report I have started working on the actual web page and begun programming it in Html, 
JavaScript as well as CSS. The database has been created with SQL and will be linked to the web page with PHP. 

2. Describe any significant progress made by the team as a whole in this time period.

It has bee a slow process due to my communication with the client. The client works third shift for Longview PD so 
trying to get our schedules to match has been a challenge. The client hasnt sent me the pictures of their products yet so the
products portion of the web page hasnt had much work done to it as of yet.
