				<p>In 2012, the Bishop's bought an old farm house in Longview on three acres. 
				They continued to develop the land and added farm animals. Gary and Angie took advantage of the resources 
				the animals provided them and began selling products. They attend courses and workshops that has developed 
				and fine-tunes the 'farm-life'. They continue to strive to add more products and welcome feedback for 
				continuous improvements and satisfaction of products.</p>
