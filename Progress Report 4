1. What have you done personally since your last progress report?

Since the last progress report I have uploaded all of the photos I was given by the client as well as finishing the database 
to connect to the webpage. It has been a challenge since becuase the client has not been very helpful or proactive in helping finish
the project but I have done my best to make the webpage the best that i can without the clients help.

2. Describe any significant progress made by the team as a whole in this time period.

Since I have been doing the project alone, I have only finished uploading all of the clients photos they have provided. The client 
has not been very helpful in their wants for the webpage. So I have had to do everything without the guideance of the clients needs.
