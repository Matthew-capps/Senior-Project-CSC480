1. What have you done personally since your last progress report?

Since the last progress report I have met with my client to show case the website I have built and took their
feedback and implemented it into the final design. The client had an issue with the products they sent me so
I have had to adjust the product page in order to fit their new request.

2. Describe any significant progress made by the team as a whole in this time period.

Since the last progress report I have begun to finalize the webpage for my client. I have finished everything for
the web page minus the Product view page. The client sent the wrong product data so I have had to go back to the drawing
board in order to fit the clients new needs. The client no longer wants the custoer to be able to add items to a cart and 
order via the web. They want a more personable connection with the client so they want the client to contact them directly
to order.
