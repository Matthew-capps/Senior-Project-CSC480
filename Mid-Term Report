Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to develop a website for a local company based out of Longview WA. The client wants a website where
a potential customer can view the products they currently have in stock and what is offered by the company at any given time. The 
client also wants the customer to be able to add items to a shopping cart and pay via PayPal or visa. Client works third shift at 
Longview PD, so it has been challenging trying to set up meetings and getting required information in order to start building the 
database and front end of the webpage.

Overall Plan:
I have chosen to work on this project alone so I will be developing and programming all stages of the website. I just have just 
received the information on the products the client sells so I will be creating the database and tables needed for the website. 
After this is complete, I will begin to work on the front end of the website and provide the client with a few examples of webpages 
I have developed in the past. The client doesnâ€™t have a clear layout in mind and my hopes with the examples of what I can do will 
spark the clients interested so that they will have a better picture on what they want their website to look like in the end. 
Overall the project has been smooth minus some communication issues at the start but once I received the products information 
from the client, I have been adding the information to the database with an expected finish date by 16 March 2019. After this is 
complete then I will begin to program the front webpage.
