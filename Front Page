					<p><b><i>Few of our goat friends</i></b></p>
					<p>Gary & Angie Bishop live in Longview, Washington with five children on three acres where they 
					raise goats, chickens, ducks and rabbits. The Bishops are mostly known for their goat soap that is 
					hand crafted.  They expanded their business recently by developing bath bombs, perfumes and lotions. 
					<p>All their products are used with all-natural ingredients and milk from their goats. Gary and Angie 
					work full time, but their goal is to one day retire and sell their products at local Farmer Markets.</p>
